# SafeReach Permission Handling System

## Problem Description
The original permission handling system had an issue where it repeatedly asked for location permissions every time the app opened. This happened because:

1. Permissions were checked in multiple places without persistent state tracking
2. Permission request state was not saved between app launches
3. There was no proper handling for "Don't ask again" cases
4. Permissions were requested immediately rather than at appropriate times

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Persistent Permission State Management
- Created a `PermissionManager` class to centrally track permission states
- Used DataStore to persist whether permissions had been requested before
- Added special handling for permanently denied permissions (when user selects "Don't ask again")

### 2. Centralized Permission ViewModel
- Added a `PermissionViewModel` that centralizes all permission-related state and logic
- Manages permission state flows that can be observed by all components
- Handles updating and refreshing permission states

### 3. Improved Permission Request Flow
- Using `rememberSaveable` to maintain permission state across configuration changes
- Added proper handling for all permission scenarios:
   - First-time requests
   - "Don't ask again" cases (directing to app settings)
   - Permission rationale showing

### 4. Contextual Permission Requests
- Permissions are now requested only when needed (e.g., when trying to use location features)
- Added proper user feedback through Snackbars when permissions are denied
- Provided clear explanations of why permissions are needed

### 5. Integration with Existing Systems
- Updated `SafeReachApp`, `MainActivity`, and navigation components to use the new system
- Made permission checks aware of the user's previous choices
- Added permission state logging for debugging

## Files Changed

1. New Files:
   - `app/src/main/java/com/example/safereach/data/local/PermissionManager.kt` - Main permission state manager
   - `app/src/main/java/com/example/safereach/presentation/viewmodel/PermissionViewModel.kt` - ViewModel for permission state

2. Modified Files:
   - `app/src/main/java/com/example/safereach/utils/PermissionUtils.kt` - Updated utilities with better composables
   - `app/src/main/java/com/example/safereach/presentation/components/LocationPermissionsDialog.kt` - Enhanced dialog
   - `app/src/main/java/com/example/safereach/MainActivity.kt` - Added permission initialization
   - `app/src/main/java/com/example/safereach/presentation/navigation/SafeReachNavigation.kt` - Added permission objects
   - `app/src/main/java/com/example/safereach/di/AppModule.kt` - Added PermissionManager provider
   - `app/src/main/java/com/example/safereach/presentation/screens/emergency/EmergencyTriggerScreen.kt` - Used new permission system

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Check Before Requesting**
   - Always check if permission is already granted before requesting
   - Use `ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission` for compatibility

2. **Proper Jetpack Compose Integration**
   - Using `rememberLauncherForActivityResult` with `ActivityResultContracts`
   - Using `rememberSaveable` to persist permission state across configuration changes

3. **Rationale Handling**
   - Checking for rationale showing using `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale`
   - Displaying appropriate UI for different permission states

4. **Settings Navigation**
   - Properly directing users to app settings when permissions are permanently denied
   - Providing clear instructions on what settings to change

5. **State Persistence**
   - Using DataStore to remember permission request history
   - Avoiding repeated prompts by tracking permanent denial

## Usage

To request location permissions using the new system:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun YourScreen(
    permissionManager: PermissionManager,
    permissionViewModel: PermissionViewModel
) {
    // Get permission state
    val locationPermissionGranted by permissionViewModel.locationPermissionState.collectAsState()
    
    // Request permissions using the utility 
    PermissionUtils.RequestLocationPermission(
        permissionManager = permissionManager,
        snackbarHostState = yourSnackbarHostState, // Optional
        onPermissionResult = { granted ->
            if (granted) {
                // Permission granted - do your location work
            } else {
                // Handle denied case
            }
        }
    )
    
    // Rest of your UI
}
```
